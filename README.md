## Welcome to Vallabh's Portfolio

This website was created primarily to share my data science projects and learnings with anyone who's willing to listen to my ramblings. But it may evolve over time.

### About Me

My name is Vallabh Reddy. I have a bachelor's in Computer Science and a master's in Business Analytics. I have been working in the Data Science field since 2015 across a few domains, namely, fintech, healthcare and retail. Mu Sigma, a decision sciences firm to which companies outsource their analytics and problem solving, was my first company. After which I worked at Amazon's Last Mile department. I'm a 2020 University of Cincinnati grad. Yes, I'm one from the Coronavirus wave of Bearcats.

In my free time I like to read non-fiction works detailing natural and man-made systems and I play squash and videogames. Also, I'm always willing to try new board games.
