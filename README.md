# Welcome to Vallabh's Portfolio

This website exists primarily to share my data science projects and learnings with anyone who's willing to listen to my ramblings. But it may evolve over time.

## About Me

My name is Vallabh Reddy. I have a bachelor's in Computer Science and a master's in Business Analytics. I have been working in the Data Science field since 2015 across a few domains, namely, fintech, healthcare and retail. Mu Sigma, a decision sciences firm to which companies outsource their analytics and problem solving, was my first company. After which I worked at Amazon's Last Mile department. I'm a 2020 University of Cincinnati grad. Yes, I'm one from the Coronavirus wave of Bearcats.

In my free time I like to read non-fiction works detailing natural and man-made systems and I play squash and videogames. Also, I'm always willing to try new board games.

## 1. Image Classification on the Fashion MNIST dataset using Convolutional Neural Networks <a name = 'fashion_MNIST'></a>

Github does not represent certain features of a jupyter notebook well, such as the intra notebook anchors, so here's a link to open the notebook through **NBViewer** - [link](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/VallabhReddy/Image-Classification-Fashion-MNIST-CNN/blob/master/Fashion%20MNIST%20Image%20Classification.ipynb)

Here is the **Github link** for the same notebook - [link](https://github.com/VallabhReddy/Image-Classification-Fashion-MNIST-CNN/blob/master/Fashion%20MNIST%20Image%20Classification.ipynb)


### Introduction
```markdown
The objective of this project was to build an image classifier that could recognize the category of apparel in the photo fed into it.
```
### Dataset
```markdown
The model is trained and tested on the Fashion MNIST dataset. The dataset is provided by the research branch of Zalando, a European e-commerce company. The dataset is made up of 28x28 grayscale images of 10 categories of apparel. The mapping for these categories is given below.
